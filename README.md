# Raspberry Pi Configuration
Step by step to set up a Compute Module Raspberry Pi.

## Step1: Burning Image
first you need to bur Image, I ususally use follwoing options:

### Raspberry Pi OS
You can get it from [raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/](https://www.raspberrypi.com/sowftware/operating-systems/).   
You can choose 32bit or 64bit OS but my daily experience shows that 64bit version, as of now (Apr 2023), specially regarding Wifi is a bit unstable.   
So we download 32bit Lite version [Direct Link for February 21st 2023 version](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_armhf/images/raspios_lite_armhf-2023-02-22/2023-02-21-raspios-bullseye-armhf-lite.img.xz)

### DietPi OS
This is the recommended one [from here](https://dietpi.com/#downloadinfo)
